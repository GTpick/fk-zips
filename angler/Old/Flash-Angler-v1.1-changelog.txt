c7ebb7dff380 Update init.profiles.rc by deani77
d06421a92af9 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/osm0sis/AnyKernel2 into angler-flash-public-7.1.2 by Nathan Chancellor
bed7deffb75c Ramdisk: Update GlassCannon profile by Nathan Chancellor
b91ec4deda63 AK2: better fix for unknown hash type - https://github.com/osm0sis/AnyKernel2/commit/45bfc5d602582c53433bd2398bdc5876a7e260c9 broke the error catching on unpackbootimg - more easily worked around during repack, see linked commit for rationale for the assumption by osm0sis
adc21ed2c375 AK2: allow next blank line (" ") for replace_section and remove_section - sometimes it's difficult to anchor to specific end lines due to variations across ROMs, so allow the end line to be blank " " - note this will also remove the trailing blank line so for replacements a trailing \n should be added to maintain spacing; this should be pretty intuitive since you are including the blank line as the end line search by osm0sis
